        Mathematics as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will,
        the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection. Its
        basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and construction,
        generality and individuality. — Richard Courant, German-American
        mathematician, As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they
        are not certain, and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to
        reality. — Albert Einstein
